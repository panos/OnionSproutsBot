# OnionSproutsBot

Telegram bot for delivering The Tor Project's software to people in sensitive geographical areas.

## Development status

**This project is currently in early development stages and is currently merely conceptual.**

Although the initial codebase and plans for the project were created under the perception that this project will remain separated from The Tor Project, the final goal now is to hopefully adapt the project for The Tor Project's preexisting [gettor](https://gitweb.torproject.org/gettor.git/) solution, which will assist in the reach, usefulness and the impact of this work.

Needless to say, this project **should not be adapted for any sort of purpose that can be deemed as sensitive** and not purely experimental. Development may cease at any time, but the progress here is going to influence the final result, if something good comes out of it.

**All sort of feedback is immensely appreciated and will be taken into serious consideration.***
